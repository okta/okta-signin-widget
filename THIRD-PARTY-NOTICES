writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any 
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any 
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to 
use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work 
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial 
damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the 
possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or 
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, 
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations 
and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such 
obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole 
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree

q.js
Version (if any):		
Brief Description:	If a function cannot return a value or throw an 
exception without blocking, it can return a promise instead. A promise is an 
object that represents the return value or the thrown exception that the 
function may eventually provide. A promise can also be used as a proxy for a 
remote object to overcome latency. On the first pass, promises can mitigate the 
“Pyramid of Doom”: the situation where code marches to the right faster than it 
marches forward.
