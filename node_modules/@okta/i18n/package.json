Clone the `npm` repo if you don't have it, and navigate to i18n\n[okta]$ git clone git@github.com:okta/npm.git && cd npm/i18n\n\n# 2. Install dependencies\n[npm/i18n]$ npm install\n```\n\n<a id=\"distributed-files\"></a>\n#### Distributed files\n\nThe published **i18n** module contains a *dist/* folder with the exported formats:\n\n```bash\nnode_modules/@okta/i18n/\n  dist/\n    json/\n      enduser_ja.json\n      enduser.json\n      ...\n    properties/\n      enduser_ja.properties\n      enduser.properties\n      ...\n    requirejs/\n      ja/\n        enduser.js\n        ...\n      enduser.js\n      ...\n```\n\n<a id=\"bacon\"></a>\n#### Bacon\n\nTo commit, get the :rocket: and merge through the [i18n bacon board](http://bacon.trex.saasure.com/#!/commits/i18n).\n\n<a id=\"update-i18n-version-in-downstream-projects\"></a>\n#### Update i18n version in downstream projects\n\n1. Wait for the master branch to finish all bacon test suites\n\n    When your topic branch is merged, a new bacon run is kicked off against the master branch. The master *publish* test suite will publish a beta prerelease version with your commit to the [internal npm registry](https://oktawiki.atlassian.net/wiki/display/eng/Using+the+Okta+internal+NPM+registry).\n\n2. Promote the master branch artifact.\n\n    In bacon, click the [hamburger button](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger_button) that's next to the merge button in the **master** run that was kicked off after merging your topic branch. Then choose **Promote artifact**. If you do not have the **Promote artifact** link, talk to eng-prod.\n\n3. Visit the [artifact promotion](http://bacon.trex.saasure.com/#!/reports/artifact_promotion/all) page and wait for the status of your i18n artifact to be **PROMOTED**.\n\n4. If you've made a non-breaking change, you're done! It will automatically be included the next time you run an `npm install` in the various okta-core modules.\n\n5. If your change is breaking and you had to increment the i18n [major version](http://semver.org/), you'll need to update okta-core with your changes:\n\n    - Find the release i18n version that you just promoted\n\n        ```bash\n        # The last release version will be the one you want, i.e. 2.0.0\n        $ npm view @okta/i18n versions\n        ```\n\n    - Update version in all affected downstream modules. In okta-core, use the [install-with-shrinkwrap](https://github.com/okta/npm/tree/master/install-with-shrinkwrap#install-with-shrinkwrap) package to generate the right *npm-shrinkwrap.json* file in both *clients/admin* and the root *okta-core* folder:\n\n        ```bash\n        # OKTA-CORE\n\n        # If you need to consume your changes in java land, update the root package\n        [okta-core]$ npm run installsw @okta/i18n@2.0.0\n\n        # If you need to consume your changes in client side javascript, update\n        # clients/admin\n        [okta-core/clients/admin]$ npm run installsw @okta/i18n@2.0.0\n\n        # OTHER REPOS THAT DO NOT USE INSTALL-WITH-SHRINKWRAP\n\n        # If you're updating a module that is not using install-with-shrinkwrap:\n        [your-module]$ npm install -E @okta/i18n@2.0.0 --save\n        ```\n\n### Developer\n\n<a id=\"link-your-changes-to-the-monolith\"></a>\n#### Link your changes to the monolith\n\n> We are currently working on a more general approach that applies to any project\n\nIf you're working in [okta-core](https://github.com/okta/okta-core), we've written a command for easier development:\n\n```bash\n# Link i18n changes to okta-core\n[i18n]$ npm run link\n```\n\nThis sets up a [watch task](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-contrib-watch) that triggers when changes are made to *.properties*:\n\n1. Packages the [exported formats](#distributed-files)\n2. Copies to original paths in okta-core\n\nOnce you've set up the link, your previous okta-core workflow will be the same - after the files have been copied by the watch task:\n```bash\n# Javascript\n[okta-core]$ ant deploy.modified.ui.i18n\n\n# Java (controller or jsp that consumes resources/i18n/*.properties)\n[okta-core]$ ant smoke.tomcat deploy.modified.code start.tomcat.debug.async\n```\n\n**Note:** You must exit the link with **ctrl+c**.\n\n<a id=\"updating-existing-properties-files\"></a>\n#### Updating existing .properties files\n\nLocalization strings are stored in *.properties* files in the [properties/](https://github.com/okta/npm/tree/master/i18n/properties) folder.\n\nTwo things to keep in mind when updating *.properties* files:\n- Only modify the english source files. Language files are automatically generated from the [import process](#importing-diffs).\n- Do not manually modify the *Last translated sha* line at the top of the source english files.\n\n<a id=\"creating-a-new-properties-file\"></a>\n#### Creating a new .properties file\n\nAdd the new file to the *properties/* folder. It will automatically be exported to the [exported formats](#distributed-files) on the next publish.\n\nIf you want to add this file to the list of files to be translated, [read this](#adding-a-new-properties-file-for-translation).\n\n<a id=\"breaking-changes\"></a>\n#### Breaking changes\n\nSome downstream repos (like okta-core) will automatically pull in any non-breaking changes to release versions of the i18n module. Because of this, it is important to increment the i18n major version number whenever making any breaking changes - specifically, when you delete properties.\n\nTo update the major version number:\n\n```bash\n# Bumps package.json version number to next major version\n[npm/i18n]$ npm version major\n```\n\n### Translations\n\n<a id=\"generating-diffs\"></a>\n#### Generating diffs\n\n> This is automated as part of the code-freeze process. At code-freeze, the diff is added to the weekly release notes, and an email is sent to the localization team.\n\n```bash\n# Generate diff-{current_sha}.properties file\n[i18n]$ npm run diff\n```\n\nThis command will generate a single *diff-{current_sha}.properties* file that contains all changes that have been made to the [tracked .properties files](#adding-a-new-properties-file-for-translation) since the last translation.\n\nThis file is sent to the translation vendor, and is composed of four sections:\n\n1. **Translate** - new properties that need to be translated.\n2. **Copy** - properties that have been renamed or duplicated across *.properties* files\n3. **Delete** - properties that have been deleted\n4. **Metadata** - additional metadata like the sha that this diff has been generated from\n\nSections 2-4 are commented out. This signals to the translators that they can ignore these sections when translating the file. The translator returns the file with the **Translate** section converted to the target language, where it can then be [imported](#importing-diffs).\n\n<a id=\"adding-a-new-language\"></a>\n#### Adding a new language\n\nAdding a new language is similar to the regular diff flow, except that the generated diff file includes **all** properties across **all** [tracked *.properties* files](#adding-a-new-properties-file-for-translation).\n\nThis must be done manually when we've decided to add a new language:\n\n1. Checkout the sha that was used to generate the regular diff.\n\n    > It is important to use the same sha because of how we internally track when to apply the diff.\n\n2. Generate the *diffall-{current_sha}.properties* file\n\n    ```bash\n    # Generates a diffall-{current_sha}.properties file with all properties\n    [i18n]$ npm run diff-all\n    ```\n\n<a id=\"adding-a-new-properties-file-for-translation\"></a>\n#### Adding a new .properties file for translation\n\n> We currently only translate enduser facing properties\n\nThe list of tracked *.properties* files is stored in the *i18ndiff* target in the *Gruntfile.js*.\n\n```javascript\n// Gruntfile.js\n'i18ndiff': {\n  propertiesFiles: [\n    'enduser',\n    'login',\n    // Add your new file here.\n    // Note: No .properties extension is needed\n    'new-properties-file'\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n<a id=\"send-diff-files-to-translation-vendor\"></a>\n#### Send diff files to translation vendor\n\nWe use [CloudWords](https://www.cloudwords.com/) to manage the translation process. For more information about this, check out the [Localization Home](https://oktawiki.atlassian.net/wiki/display/eng/Localization+Home) wiki page.\n\n<a id=\"importing-diffs\"></a>\n#### Importing diffs\n\n> The expected format for returned files is *diff-{sha}_{languageCode}.properties*\n> i.e. diff-2345957d3811d621efc1070601ff5fda8f135710_ja.properties\n\nOnce the *diff.properties* files have been returned, run the `import` command for each file to import into your current branch.\n\n```bash\n# Run this for each translated diff file\n[i18n]$ npm run import -- -file=/path/to/diff-{sha}_{language}.properties\n```\n\nSeveral things happen when this command is run:\n- All changes described in the *diff.properties* file are applied to affected files. In fact, all language *.properties* files are re-generated at this time after the operations have been applied.\n- The sha that this file was generated from is set as the *lastTranslatedSha* in the original, modified english files.\n",
