# DELETED KEYS
# If you're making a breaking change (i.e. removing a key or modifying an existing key), add the key to this section instead. When modifying keys:
# 1. Create a new name for the key and add your modified string to that property
# 2. Add the old property to this section
# We will be periodically cleaning up this section and removing old keys. This will help reduce the churn in major version numbers in okta-core.
